  UUIDs in CBOR are encoded using as registered CBOR extension Tag 37 (https://github.com/lucas-clemente/cbor-specs/blob/master/uuid.md), which in itself if a combination of CBOR major type 6, the tag's id (37) and the major type 2 (bytestring), as well as the additional information of 16 (for 16 bytes). Following that header are the 16 actual data bytes representing the UUID.

  While UUIDs in CBOR are represented as its own data type, in JSON UUIDs are to be represented as a string according to the RFC 4122 Section 3 specification (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-3), as 8-4-4-4-12 hex encoding.
