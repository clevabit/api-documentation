    type: string

      The _prefix_ defines the beginning of the resulting data series. The actual
      generated name will be combined from the given _prefix_ and the name of the
      requested aggregation. That said, as an example, a prefix set to "temperature-"
      and an aggregation of type "median" will generate a data series id of
      "temperature-median" which contains the actual devices and metrics.
