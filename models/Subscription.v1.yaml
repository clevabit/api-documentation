  The Subscription object represents a successfully executed subscription. To connect to the
  MQTT broker, either via WebSocket or using a direct MQTT socket, the presented endpoint
  must be used. This endpoint must not be cached for other subscription, may, however, be
  reused in case of a sudden disconnect. The reconnect must happen within 15 minutes after
  disconnection though, otherwise the subscription will expire.

  To connect to the MQTT server, the following setup must be used:

  | MQTT parameter | Value |
  | :--- | :--- |
  | URL | Subscription::endpoint |
  | clientId | Subscription::clientId |
  | password | Valid JWT Token |
  | qos | 0 or 1 |

  It is recommended to connect the client as a _persistent_client_ to make sure that short
  disconnects keep the subscription alive and prevent missing out on events being delivered.

  The _pushMessages_ member may contain messages, that would have since been received using
  the provided _query_ and the _lastTimestamp_ values of the SubscriptionRequest.
