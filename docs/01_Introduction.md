# Introduction

The clevabit API is organized around the 
[REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer ':target=_blank')
principle. It features predictable resource-oriented HTTP URLs.

While all request bodies are expected in JSON encoded request objects, all responses
provided by the API are encoded as [CBOR](#CBOR) objects, except stated otherwise.

The API uses standard HTTP verbs, and response codes.
